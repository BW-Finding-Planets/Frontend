# Frontend

This is a React App application that allows a user to register, login, and create a profile. The main feature of the app allows the user to look at a light wave curve, from a star, to vote on the likelihood of a star orbiting around it. The light wave curve and following information comes from our backend, and when the user votes that information is stored there as well. The website is hosted using netify.
